# Capstone Project for Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree

## About 

The data sources, for this project, were collected from Google Cloud Platform with BigQuery. A data pipeline, two data sources, was create for the Ethereum classic blockchain, i.e., blocks and transactions. All blocks and transactions in 2020 were collected.

Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain. ... This prevents fraud, because one change in any block in history would invalidate all the following blocks as all subsequent hashes would change and everyone running the blockchain would notice.

An Ethereum transaction refers to an action initiated by an externally-owned account, in other words an account managed by a human, not a contract. ... If a contract account, the transaction will execute the contract code) signature â€“ the identifier of the sender.

## Purpose

The purpose of this data pipeline is to create a dashboard.

Dashboard Elements:

1. Number of Large Transactions
2. Daily Active Addresses
3. Total Addresses
4. Ownership by Time Held
5. Transactions Made by Miners

## Data Model

A star-schema data warehouse was used represent the historical blocks and transactions. The fact table has all transactions and important block-level information, such as, miner address.

The daily raw data was stored in S3 in CSV format and partitioned on date:

block data: s3://rk-blockchain-db/block/YEAR/MONTH/DAY.csv

transaction data: s3://rk-blockchain-db/transaction/YEAR/MONTH/DAY.csv

## Data Pipeline

Airflow was used to schdule an ETL from S3 into Redshift. The data was first copied to staging tables, and the post-processing was done in Redshift during the transform phase. Data quality checks were performed after the ETL.

Backfilling was enabled in the DAG with catchup=True. The data was copied to redshift by month using the backfilling process. AWS and Redshift hooks configured in Airflow as well. A maximum of 3 "retries" were performed during the execution.

## Data Cleaning

The dates needed to be converted to TIMESTAMP because the CSV files only have text data. The next issue was the length of some of the numeric fields. The value was represent in WEI which could have more than 25 digits,  and this is larger than the maximum size for redshift. I needed to load these fields as text and then used custom post-processing to convert them to numeric. I used a X 9 multipler to represent this data. Some of the data elements, such as INPUT in the transaction table, had over 10,000 bytes. I excluded this field to save space.
